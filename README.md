## Requirements:

- [Alpha Vantange API KEY](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) -- required in src/state/api/index.js

# Exercise Description

## Background

In the financial sector users want to monitor a list of securities for potential trading or investment opportunities. A trader may utilize a “watchlist” to stay informed of securities to make investment decisions.

## Challenge:

Utilize reactJS to build a securities watchlist app. This should consist of a table of securities (stocks or bonds) with: Symbol, Price, price change (points or percentage), Currency, & any other information you would like to add. At a minimum - as a user of the watchlist I should be able to add new securities & remove existing ones.

You can mock the trading data or utilize existing open APIs available.

Feel free to utilize any popular react component, css, or state management libraries available.
